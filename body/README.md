# Motion Pose Node

This module provides a set of nodes in Node-RED for recognizing body posture.

Track and visualize body posture using [BlazePose](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose.html) model from Mediapipe.

Estimated postures can be stored through the 'Pose Register' node, and 'Pose Find' node can determine the similarity with other postures.

These nodes require node.js version 14.17.0 and Node-RED 2.0.6.

## Pre-requisites

The Motion-Pose-Node requires [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) to be installed.

## Install

To install the latest version use the `Menu - Manage palette` option and search for `node-red-contrib-motion-pose-node`, or run the following command in you Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red` :

    npm install node-red-contrib-motion-pose-node
